#This project utilizes the following Superstore data: 

CREATE TABLE superstore (
    item_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    item_name TEXT,
    category TEXT,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    stock_quantity INTEGER,
    average_rating DECIMAL(3, 2)

#For this project, I used SQL to query the Superstore database to get information about items sold at the store and their prices. 

--1. Select all data

SELECT *
FROM superstore;

--2. Find Top 5 items with highest rating in descending order

SELECT item_name, average_rating
FROM superstore
ORDER BY average_rating DESC
LIMIT 5;

--3. Find items with stock quantity with 30 or less in descending order along with average rating 4 or over

SELECT item_name, stock_quantity, average_rating
FROM superstore
WHERE stock_quantity <= 30 AND average_rating >= 4
ORDER BY stock_quantity DESC, average_rating DESC;

--4. This query summarizes the superstore inventory by category, but only includes categories where the average customer rating is 4.5 or higher in descending order.

SELECT
    category,
    COUNT(*) AS total_items,                 -- Total number of items in the category
    SUM(stock_quantity) AS total_stock,      -- Total stock quantity per category
    AVG(price) AS avg_price,                 -- Average price per category
    MIN(price) AS cheapest_item,             -- Lowest priced item in the category
    MAX(price) AS most_expensive_item,       -- Highest priced item in the category
    AVG(average_rating) AS avg_rating        -- Average rating per category
FROM superstore
GROUP BY category
HAVING AVG(average_rating) >= 4.5           -- Only include categories with avg rating >= 4.5
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC;
